This repo is elligible for counting your Pull request in Hacktober Fest.

First and Foremost register yourself on https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com and then click

# 1. Fork this repo into your account
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.
# 2. Clone it into your PC (using command line for comfort)
Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.
Now let's bring the cloned repository to your local machine. Open your git bash terminal and write the following commands.
```sh

$ git clone <url-you-just-copied>

```
# 3. Add files to the folder and push it into your repo
Since you want to change the files inside, first let's move to the folder correctly. Use the following command on the terminal:
```sh

$ cd Hacktober-Fest-2020

```
After that make a folder of your name and write ```sh cd <your folder name>' ```
After that make the required changes into that folder like adding a file or your projects.
# 4. Push the changes to your local repo
Now you have made the required changes, it's time to push the code. Run the following commands in the terminal
```sh

$ cd .. (To get back into the main folder)

$ git add . (Adding your changes)

$ git commit -m "Your folder name" (Commit your changes)

$ git push (Pushing the changes to the local repo)

```
# 5. Click on create New Pull Request
Now go to your local repo which you have forked and check if the changes you made are there or not. If you can't find the changes, then probably you have done something wrong.   Follow the steps again. If your changes are there, then click on `Pull requests` tab and click on `Create New Pull Request` button.
# 6. Add proper comments and commit.
Once you see `Able to merge` on your screen, create the pull request and add proper comments (preferably your name and PR number) and click on create pull request 

This completes 1 pull request.
Now go to your hacktober fest profile and check if the counter for pull requests have increased. If it increased then you have successfully completed 1 PR.
Repeat the above steps and further add the changes in the folder you created already. Don't need to create a separate folder everytime.

Minimum 4 Pull requests are required to complete the challenge.
But Make 5-6 such to secure the prizes.

Every PR is accepted as soon as I can. Just follow the community guidelines.

If this helped you then Star the repo!!
