If you're new to markdown, here's some tips on how to use it!

## Headings

Use `#` to indicate your headings. For example, if you want `h2`, use

`## Your Title`

## Bold/Itallics/Emphasis

Wrap your text in `**` if you want it bolded, or `_` (or `*`) if you want it emphasized!

**Like this** or _like this_

## Links

Need to share links? Just use this format:

`[name of your link](url)`.

Pro-tip: You can share images, like gifs, in a similar way! Just use an `!` in front of the `[` for example...

`![alt text for image](https://media.giphy.com/media/IwAZ6dvvvaTtdI8SD5/giphy.gif)`

## Lists

To use lists, just preface each item with a dash `-`

- Just
- Like
- This

Pro-tip: Want to make checklists? Use `- [ ]` and you can check them off!

- [x] Make a checklist
- [ ] Check it off
